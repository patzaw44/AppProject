Yeah.... My name is Marshall.\ngroup: Hello Marshall.\n\n[Introduction]\nYeah...\nIt's my life...\nMy own words I guess...\n\n[Verse 1]\nHave you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?\nNot the expression, no, literally give an arm for?\nWhen they know they're your heart\nAnd you know you were their armour\nAnd you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her\nBut what happens when karma turns right around and bites you?\nAnd everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?\nWhat happens when you become the main source of her pain?\n\"Daddy look what I made\", Dad's gotta go catch a plane\n\"Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?\"\nI don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy\nDaddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself\nI'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself\nThen turn right around in that song and tell her you love her\nAnd put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her\nThat's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy\nShady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm looking down on you smiling\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain\nJust smile back\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm looking down on you smiling\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain\nJust smile back...\n\n[Verse 2]\nI keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing\nShe keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing\n\"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?\"\nBaby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, \"Daddy you're lying\n\"You always say that, you always say this is the last time\n\"But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine\"\nShe's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it\n\"Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!\"\nGoes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket\nIt's got a picture, \"this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'\"\nI look up, it's just me standing in the mirror\nThese fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em\nThey're saying \"You've got one more chance to do right\" - and it's tonight\nNow go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late\nAnd just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door\nIt turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on\nAnd I'm singing...\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm looking down on you smiling\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain\nJust smile back\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm looking down on you smiling\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain\nJust smile back...\n\n[Verse 3]\nSixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat\nThe curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet\nI take a bow and thank you all for coming out\nThey're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd\nI glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing\n\"Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,\"\nBut baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?\n\"I followed you Daddy, you told me that you ain't leavin'\n\"You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad\n\"And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'\n\"That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin\n\"I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are going\"\nBut baby wait, \"it's too late Dad, you made the choice\n\"Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us\"\nThat's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name\nIt's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill\nYeah, I bet you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real\nI hear applause, all this time I couldn't see\nHow could it be, that the curtain is closing on me\nI turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it\nPut it to my brain and scream \"die Shady\" and pop it\nThe sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes\nThat's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'\nIt's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her\nTell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister\nAlmost as if to say..\n\n[Chorus/Outro]\n\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm looking down on you smiling\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain\nJust smile back\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm looking down on you smiling\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain\nJust smile back...\n\n[Curtains closing and sounds of clapping]"

    "lyrics": "I was in the winter of my life. And the men I met along the road were my only summer. At night I fell sleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them. Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me and my only real happy times.\n\nI was a singer, not a very popular one. I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet. But upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like million stars in the night sky. That I wished on over and over again sparkling and broken. But I really didn\u2019t mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is.\n\nWhen the people I used to know found out what I had been doing, how I had been living, they asked me why but there\u2019s no use in talking to people who have a home. They have no idea what it\u2019s like to seek safety in other people for home to be wherever you lie you head.\n\nI was always an unusual girl. My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul, no moral compass pointing me due north, no fixed personality, just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and wavering as the ocean. And if I said I didn\u2019t plan for it to turn out this way, I\u2019d be lying.\n\nBecause I was born to be the other woman who belonged to no one, who belonged to everyone, who had nothing, who wanted everything, with a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn\u2019t even talk about it and pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me.\n\nI've been out on that open road\nYou can be my full time daddy, white and gold\nSinging blues has been getting old\nYou can be my full time baby, hot or cold\n\nDon't break me down\nI've been traveling too long\nI've been trying too hard\nWith one pretty song\n\nI hear the birds on the summer breeze\nI drive fast, I am alone at midnight\nBeen trying hard not to get into trouble\nBut I, I've got a war in my mind\nSo I just ride, just ride, I just ride, I just ride\n\nDying young and playing hard\nThat's the way my father made his life an art\nDrink all day and we talk till dark\nThat\u2019s the way the road dogs do it, light till dark\n\nDon't leave me now\nDon't say goodbye\nDon't turn around\nLeave me high and dry\n\nI hear the birds on the summer breeze\nI drive fast, I am alone at midnight\nBeen trying hard not to get in trouble\nBut I, I've got a war in my mind\nI just ride, just ride, I just ride, I just ride\n\nI'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy\nI'm tired of driving till I see stars in my eyes\nIt's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby\nSo I just ride, I just ride\n\nI hear the birds on the summer breeze\nI drive fast, I am alone at midnight\nBeen trying hard not to get in trouble\nBut I, I've got a war in my mind\nI just ride, just ride, I just ride, I just ride\n\nEvery night I used to pray that I\u2019d find my people and finally I did on the open road. We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore except to make our lives into a work of art. Live fast. Die young. Be wild. And have fun.\n\nI believe in the country America used to be. I believe in the person I want to become. I believe in the freedom of the open road. And my motto is the same as ever. I believe in the kindness of strangers. And when I'm at war with myself, I ride. I just ride.\n\nWho are you? Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies? Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them? I have. I am fucking crazy. But I am free."

It was so clear that he was the only one for me. We both knew it right away. And as the years went on things got more difficult. We were faced with more challenges. \n\nI begged him to stay, try to remember what we had at the beginning. He was charismatic, magnetic, electric and everybody knew it. When he walked in every woman's head turned, everyone stood up to talk to him. He was like this hybrid, this mix of a man who couldn't contain himself. \n\nI always got the sense that he became torn between being a good person and missing out on all of the opportunities that life could offer a man as magnificent as him. And in that way I understood him and I loved him. I loved him. I loved him. I loved him. And I still love him. I love him."

None of it's real\nYou want to be an MC you've got to study the skill\n\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nBring it to you every time like this?\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nStep, step up, step, step up, step up\n\nSo you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity\nBut mentally you don't have the hip hop energy\nWith a tendency to make up stories\nSounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top 40\nAnd your record company is completely missing it\nAll the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate\nSo in a battle you can't hack it\nReact with whack shit\nAnd get smacked with verbal back flips\nGet your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts\nIt's taken decades for emcees to establish this\nYou're new to hip hop and welcome if your serious\nBut not on the mic\nLeave that to the experienced\n\n(Using the waves of sound the true master paralyzes his opponents, leaving him vulnerable to attack)\n\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nBring it to you every time like this?\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nStep, step up, step, step up, step up\n\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nBring it to you every time like this?\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nStep, step up, step, step up, step up\n\n(After years of pain staking research by the world's leading sound scientists, we here at the sound institute have invented a reliable audio weapons system. Actual movement of musical sound in space used to carefully attack and neutralize the cellular structure of the human body, and the question must be asked.)\n\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nBring it to you every time like this?\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nStep, step up, step, step up, step up\n\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nBring it to you every time like this?\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nStep, step up, step, step up, step up"

    "lyrics": "[Intro: Jack Patterson]\nIn the quiet of my room\nI gather up my thoughts and questions\nCould I ever be like you?\nCould I ever be a person, so real and so true?\nIt seems implausible\nI look at my reflection\nIf only I could say\nThe things I never mention\nThe things you never knew\n\n[Chorus: Jack Patterson]\nAnd I'd like to thank you for the human I've become\nI'm sorry if I've let you down\nI'm trying, I'm learning as I stumble along\nTo see this new world without your eyes\n\n[Verse 1: Lizzo]\nOnce upon a time there was a girl who so much loved the world\nShe have her only begotten sunshine\nAnd dried her stained eyes on a neck tie\nTook the best lies made 'em truths\nAnd spit sad soliloquies in the booth\nCause people think they know but they barely knew\nThe reality of what the other-siders do\nBut I've been there, I've learnt that\nSeen a whole bunch of world and done came back\nGot a reckoning for wrecking in my knapsack\n'Bout to journey on foot through the outback\nGRRRL PRTY is the label on my snapback\nDoin' worldwide shows in a black hat\n'Bout to tell your ass a story so take that\nFree prophecies from a black cat\n\n[Verse 2: Lizzo]\nSeen his demise with a pair of brand new eyes\nIt was sickening, guy\nNever wanted to be stickin' it to thickening thighs\nBut now he deeper than the secrets that he keep with a lie\n\"Mm, tastes good!\" baby say with a cry\nNow wait...\nThinkin' about it too much, too much\nDeepen the profit sooner, sooner\nHe never wanted to be a loser\nBut the bruises of losing is oozing through his fingers\nThe tips that like to brush at my hips\nIs now at the hilt of a sword, Lord\nOn the battlefield, torn, sworn\nTo never think about another lover\nHopin' he had time to recover but nothing's ever easy\nBeware the sting of queen bee (grr!)\n\n[Chorus: Jack Patterson]\n\n[Verse 3: Lizzo]\nSo many things in he I would like to be\nWiser, more light on my feet\nI could look up in the mirror and change me\nOr right over my shoulder and save me\nThinkin' about back, back when, when I ain't have nothing\nNot a thing or a ring to my name\nNow my feet in the game, knee deep, don't speak\nFeelin' like Gwen Stefani in this thing\nBut I can't complain cause we asked for this\nFeelin' like a workaholic or a masochist\nDon't call like I should like its sacrilege\nTo make a dollar in a dream into packed venues\nTake a second, put your shield down\nLaying down my sword, getting off the battlefield now\nMakin' bigger moves, bigger pictures in my view now\nGet up out of my way I've got ammo for days, pow!\n\n[Bridge: Lizzo]\nI can feel the weight of wars you've lost\nThey're victories in my eyes\nEvery swing you take brings me closer and closer\nOpen the gates and I'm poised to charge\nYou told me we'd never get this far\nNow we at the final round\nThere's no way we'll escape battle scars\nBattle scars\n\n[Chorus: Jack Patterson]"

I can barely decide\nI just drank a fifth of vodka - dare me to drive?

(Wah!)\nYou ain't got no tits! (Wahhh!)\nI lay awake and strap myself in the bed\nWith a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (BANG!)\nI'm steaming mad (Arrrggghhh!)\nAnd by the way when you see my dad?
